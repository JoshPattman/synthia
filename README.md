# Synthia - The best synth in the world
- Toy project to play with sound waves.
- Uses composition to build up effects from generated or recorded sound, playing them as notes.
- Supports interactive mode and playback mode.
## Usage
- `$ go run . -mode interactive`
    - This will use the `instruments.json` file and load a piano in interactive mode.
    - The numbers and qwerty rows will play notes (including the # notes).
    - Z and X will shift the octave up/down.
    - Shift will reset recording / print the reconding to stdout.
    - Ctrl will reset recording / print the normalised (to closest .25 notes) to stdout.
- `$ cat ./songs/sad_cats.txt | go run . -mode play`
    - This will also use `instruments.json` and also the specified song and will play it (on loop).
    - See below documentation for the file format of songs.
## Music File Format
- I have built a simple file format for writing music.
- It works by defining larger and larger building blocks until you have a song.
- See the `./songs` directory for examples.
- Each file is made up of multiple named subsections: `<MyCoolSubSection>...</>`.
- Each subsection contains multiple instructions separated by semicolos, for example `p-e-4-0.5;a-0.5;i-MySubSection;t-instrument_name;`.
    - Play a note: `p-(notename)-(octave)-(duration);`.
    - Advanced in timeline: `a-(duration);`.
    - Insert a subsection: `i-(subsectionname);`.
    - Set the instrument (tied to instruments.json): `t-(instrumentname);`.
- The file format is completely whitespace insensitive.
- You can make comments by surrounding them in square brackets.
- How does the timeline work?:
    - Each subsection has a head. The head is the current time at which we are inserting notes.
    - Playing a note DOES NOT move the head. To play two notes at once, simply play them without an advance command in the middle.
    - The only way to move the head is to use an advanced command.
    - Moving a head from a subsection does not move the head of the subsection that called it. i.e. If you call two subsections without a delay between them, they run in parallell.
- How does setting instruments work?
    - When you set an instrument, it is set until you change it.
    - This includes setting it for subsections that this subsection calls.
